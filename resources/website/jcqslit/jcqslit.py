    ## Project Overview

    The primary goal of our project, Golden State Housing Insights, is to predict housing prices in the state of California. 
     Our team aims to achieve this by leveraging machine learning models to analyze various factors, including investor return on investment (ROI), affordability, distance between homes and cities, and specific home features.
     By integrating these elements, we strive to provide accurate and actionable insights into the California housing market, aiding investors, homebuyers, and policymakers in making informed decisions.
   ‚òÄÔ∏è 
    ## Business Scenario 
    
      We approached our business problem as independent real estate consultants. Our client, who recently accepted a job offer in California, seeks to purchase a home in the area. They have tasked us with identifying the top 5 metro areas with the highest return on investment (ROI) based on a home feature analysis. Additionally, we will predict near-term interest rates using Time Series modeling and linear regression to support their decision-making.
    
      ## Model Training & Testing

      #### - **Housing Price Prediction using Zillow Data**

      Our team employed a comprehensive data pre-processing approach to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our housing price predictions. We utilized powerful libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib was used for visualizing data trends and patterns. We also applied data melting techniques to reshape our datasets, making them more suitable for analysis. Additionally, we incorporated time series analysis to account for temporal trends and seasonality in housing prices. This robust pre-processing framework enabled us to prepare our data effectively for machine learning modeling. Our team conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the housing data. This initial step allowed us to gain valuable insights and informed our subsequent modeling approach.     
      
      #### - **Interest Rate Prediction**

      To predict future interest rates up to February 2025, the code utilizes historical data from a CSV file ('fed-rates.csv'). The data spans from January 2017 to December 2024, and is cleaned to calculate average monthly rates.

      
      #### - **Housing Feature**

      To prepare the dataset for analysis, we began by removing outliers by filtering extreme values in the features AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, and AveOccup. We then used a heatmap to identify the most impactful variables for predicting house prices. The data was split into training and testing sets, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for testing using the train_test_split() function. Finally, we standardized the values using StandardScaler() to ensure consistent scaling across features.
      To predict housing market trends and analyze influential home features, we utilized the Ames dataset, assuming Californians have similar preferences. We began by preprocessing the dataset, removing features with sparse data and encoding non-numerical features. A correlation analysis was then conducted to identify the 12-15 most influential home features based on their correlation with home prices.

This automation was necessary due to the impracticality of manually analyzing each area. We evaluated the models' accuracy by comparing their predictions for December 2024 with actual observed values. The ARIMA model's predictions were **9%** off observed values with **91%** accuracy, while the SARIMA model's predictions were **14%** off observed values with **86%** accuracy.
                           Despite SARIMA showing better ROI for the top 5 metro areas, ARIMA's lower error rate suggests it could be more accurate with additional data. The ARIMA model predicted a return on investment (ROI) percentage range of **3%** to **6%**, whereas the SARIMA model predicted an ROI a of **6%** . For model optimization, both ARIMA and SARIMA had high RMSE values, **2432.90** and **3547.65** respectively. A model with a high RMSE has more error and less precise predictions, as this value should ideally be below **100**. """)

Assuming the historical patterns continue, the models could potentially forecast whether interest rates are likely to increase, decrease, or remain stable in the near future (e.g., the next few months). From the code's plot titled "Interest Rate Prediction until Feb 2025," we see an upward trend in interest rates over the past years leading to now. In this scenario, we would generally anticipate a slowdown in the housing market with potentially decreased sales and slower home price appreciation. This model predicts an increase in the interest rates into Feb 2025. This is primarily because interest rates directly affect mortgage rates. Higher mortgage rates make homes less affordable, leading to decreased demand and potentially lower home prices. Lower mortgage rates make homes more affordable, potentially increasing demand and driving up home prices.

         - Santa Cruz, CA - ROI @ 1 year - 4%
         - Sacramento, CA - ROI @ 1 year - 4%
         - Bakersfield, CA - ROI @ 1 year - 4%

         
         ### Features To Consider
         - House age
         - Exterior Quality
         - Garage Size
         - Living space size
         - Kitchen quality
         
         ### Model Updates
         The prediction percentages come from models trained on five years of data to predict two years ahead. We plan to use ten years of training data to predict just one year ahead. This suggests that our future predictions will likely be even more accurate than those in this validation test. By leveraging a larger dataset, we aim to enhance the reliability and precision of our investment recommendations.
