## Application Development

For the Mystic AI application, the application development steps involved preparing model prompt, user inputs, managing API responses, and ensuring the generated content is suitable for display. Below is an outline of the data and preprocessing steps:

1. **User Input Handling**:
   - **Input**: Users provide a story genre or theme and their OpenAI API key.
   - **Validation**: 
     - Ensure the API key starts with `sk-` to confirm it is valid.
     - Sanitize the genre input to remove unnecessary whitespace or invalid characters.
2. **API Key Authentication**:
   - Store the OpenAI API key securely in the session state.
   - Set the key as an environment variable for use in API calls.
3. **Language Model Response Processing**:
   - **Input**: User-provided genre or story continuation is sent to OpenAI's ChatGPT.
   - **Response Parsing**:
     - Split the response into lines and filter out empty lines or separators (e.g., `-- -- --`).
     - Identify and separate the story text, user choice labels, and options.
     - Ensure options are limited to a maximum of 6 for better user experience.
4. **Image Prompt Extraction**:
   - Extract the image prompt from the ChatGPT response (if present).
   - Remove any lines related to image generation from the story text.
5. **Image Generation**:
   - Use the extracted image prompt to generate an image with DALL-E.
   - Validate the generated image:
     - Ensure the image meets the minimum size requirement (e.g., 256x256 pixels).
     - Resize the image if necessary to meet display requirements.
6. **Session State Management**:
   - Store the processed story, user options, and generated image in the session state.
   - Maintain a list of story sections (`cols`) to dynamically render content.
7. **Dynamic Content Rendering**:
   - Use the processed data to display the story, user choices, and images in the app.
   - Ensure user interactions (e.g., radio button selections) are captured and processed to generate the next part of the story.
8. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle API errors (e.g., invalid API key, rate limits) gracefully by displaying appropriate warnings.
   - Provide fallback behavior if image generation fails (e.g., display text-only content).

## Performance Optimization - 

### DALL-E 3 Image Model
**Information**
-
**Baseline Performance:**
- Prompt passed directly from GPT: Initially, the prompt was used as-is, directly from GPT without any modifications or cleanup. No cleanup: The DALLE prompt contained various formatting issues such as newline (\n) and carriage return (\r) characters, as well as unnecessary prefixes.
- Response Time Results
   - ![image](resources/content/perf_bl1.png)
   - ![image](resources/content/perf_bl2.png)

**Prompt Cleanup:**
   - Implemented DALLE prompt cleanup code: To enhance performance, we developed code that systematically cleans up the given DALLE prompt. This involves:
      - Removing newline (\n) and carriage return (\r) characters: These characters were eliminated to ensure the DALLE prompt is a single, continuous string.
      - Iteratively removing specific prefixes: The code removes a predefined set of prefixes that are often unnecessary and can clutter the prompt.
        ```bash

            prompt = prompt.replace("\n", " ").replace("\r", " ")
            for prefix in ["Prompt:", "Visual Prompt:", "Image Prompt:", "A.", "B.", "C.", "D.", "E.", "F.", "A)", "B)", "C)", "D)", "E)", "F)"]:
            prompt = prompt.replace(prefix, "")
        ``` 
      - This cleanup process results in a more streamlined and efficient DALLE prompt, which can be processed more effectively by the tool.
   - Simplifying prompt requests to DALL-E: To further optimize performance, we added a developer-recommended sentence that simplifies the prompt request. This sentence instructs the tool to use the DALLE prompt as-is without adding any additional details. The sentence is:
   ```bash

      "I NEED to test how the tool works with extremely simple prompts. DO NOT add any detail, just use it AS-IS:" + prompt
   ``` 
   - By including this sentence, we ensure that the tool processes the prompt in its simplest form, which can lead to more accurate and faster results.
   - Response Time Results

**Performance Results**
- Baseline Response Time: 14.84 seconds
- Post-Modification Response Time: 9.73 seconds
- Improvement: 34.43%

## Additional Questions and Plan for future development

### Additional Questions

1.  **How can we improve the coherence of AI-generated stories?**    
    - While ChatGPT generates engaging narratives, ensuring logical consistency across multiple story sections remains a challenge. How can we refine prompts or use memory mechanisms to improve this?
2.  **What are the limits of user interactivity?**    
    - How many choices or branching paths can we realistically support before the complexity becomes unmanageable for both the user and the application?
3.  **How can we optimize image generation?**    
    - DALL-E occasionally produces images that do not align perfectly with the story context. How can we improve prompt engineering or incorporate user feedback to refine image generation?
4.  **What additional features would enhance user engagement?**    
    - Would features like saving stories, sharing them, or adding sound effects/music improve the overall experience?
5.  **How scalable is the application?**    
    - As more users interact with the app, how can we ensure that API rate limits, server performance, and caching mechanisms can handle increased demand?
